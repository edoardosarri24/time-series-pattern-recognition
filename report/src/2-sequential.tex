\subsection{Sequential Implementation (CPU)}
The baseline solution is implemented in standard C++:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logic:} A nested loop structure iterating through all $L-M$ possible positions.
    \item \textbf{Complexity:} $O(L \times M)$.
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} Serves as the ground truth for correctness and the baseline for speedup calculations.
\end{itemize}
