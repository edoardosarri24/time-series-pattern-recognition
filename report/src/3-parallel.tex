\subsection{Parallel Implementation (CUDA)}
The accelerated solution leverages the massive parallelism of NVIDIA GPUs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kernel Design:} The sliding window logic is mapped to CUDA threads. Each thread computes the SAD for a specific window index $i$.
    \item \textbf{Memory Optimization:} The Database and Query are transferred to Global Memory. Access patterns are optimized to ensure memory coalescing.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Reduction:} A reduction algorithm is employed to efficiently identify the global minimum SAD value across thousands of concurrent threads.
\end{itemize}
